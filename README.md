# Singly-Linked-List-Operations
This program demonstrates the basic operations of a singly linked list, including inserting elements at the beginning, at the end, and at a specified position within the list. The program uses a simple struct called `node` to represent the elements of the linked list, with each node containing an integer data value and a pointer to the next node.

# Operations:

**at_beginning(int data)**: This function inserts a new node with the given data value at the beginning of the linked list.
**at_end(int data)**: This function inserts a new node with the given data value at the end of the linked list.
**insert(int data, int pos)**: This function inserts a new node with the given data value at the specified position within the linked list.

# Usage:

Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
The program will insert nodes into the linked list using the three available operations and then display the final linked list as output.

# Sample Output: 
The provided main function in the program will generate the following output:

**1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5**


This output represents the final state of the linked list after all the insert operations have been performed.

**Note**: To display the arrow (->) between the nodes and include the last nodeâ€™s data in the output, you should update the main function as shown in one of the previous responses.
