# Singly-Linked-List-Operations
This program demonstrates the basic operations of a singly linked list, including inserting elements at the beginning, at the end, and at a specified position within the list. The program uses a simple struct called `node` to represent the elements of the linked list, with each node containing an integer data value and a pointer to the next node.
